 
Name of Project: <b>HealthBuddy</b> <br/>
Theme: <b> Healthcare </b> <br/>
Target Audience: <b> Patients and Staff of The Hospital</b><br/>
Opportunity Identified: <br/>
Hospitals carry out rounding sessions for patients in their wards regularly, usually on an hourly basis. This requires manpower to go around to every bed in every ward one by one, asking the patients questions for the hospitals. Thus, I believe that there could be done efficiently and effectively through a conversational AI, and there can be additional features using an AI too, such as gamification, education etc.



Proposed Idea/Platform: <br/>
To develop a conversational AI, which prompts the users to carry out their rounding session, and users will only need to respond to the speaker, saving time for the staff and lessen their workload. The AI will also allow users to understand more about their condition, how to prevent it or how to manage it once they are discharged, which helps reduce the overcrowding issues hospitals today face. Also allowing the users to play games which can help keep their mind active and thinking. 
Originality/Value: <br/>
Voice AI is a fairly new innovation, such that most AIs, is only available in the US and not available in Singapore yet. As a result, such solutions are not fully explored or not implemented yet. However, I believe that there is a future in Voice AI, as technology progresses. By implementing Voice AI. Patients no longer need to wait for assistance and it can also serve as an entertainment hub 24/7.


 

 
Aims <br/>
*Develop an Alexa skill that will help increase the efficiency of patient charting 
 The skill must be able to take in answers of the patient and store it
*Decrease the manpower required for patient charting
Ensures that the nurses themselves do not need to go up to the patient to ask them and they can focus
*Easy to use skill
Cannot be overly complicated such that not everyone can use it



    
 

 

 
Hardware used <br/>
PC in FYP Lab
Amazon Alexa device (Amazon Echo)

Development  Environment <br/>
Windows 10
Alexa skills development Kit(Amazon)
Lamda(Python 2.7)
Visual Studios

Database Design <br/>
Using DynamoDB provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows us to store multiple values without the need of connecting the various tables.
Simple and flexible database system makes the storing and displaying data on webapp simple and viable.



External <br/>
Alexa development tutorials(https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) <br/>
Code Academy <br/>
DynamoDb( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb) <br/>

Reflection <br/>
This FYPJ exposed me to a new type of technology which i think is what will begin the next stage of technology. Learning a new language
and using a new Developer platform was a good way to learn about how alexa works and how amazon provides all these services so that
almsot anyone can use it to create and try out a new alexa skill. As someone who cans ay that he is weak in coding this project made me interested in learning more about this kind of technology. -Nevain D(154408J)
